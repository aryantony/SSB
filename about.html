        <div class="container about-us-top-para">The Integrated SSB Virtuosos, a unit of CS Joint Services Academy
            (CSJSA), was was setup on 04 July
            2021 with a goal to shape India’s youth and fuel their aspirations to join Indian Armed Forces in
            the Officer Cadre.</div>
        <section class="about-us-conatiner container">
            <div class="left-one">We are not a mere academy providing services, we are a community that supports and
                encourages students. Our founder personally guides all the students in their SSB preparation so that
                their dream of joining the Indian Armed Forces as commissioned officers can come true. Our sessions
                focus on psychological aspects of and the genesis of assessment at the Services Selection Board and
                methods to improve oneself. Lt Cdr Nikhil’s massive experience of assessing about 12500 candidates
                appearing for SSB has led to immense popularity among the students and teachers as well. We hope to
                create a niche for CSJSA so that every potential young aspiring student is able to fulfil the dream of
                serving as Officer in the Armed Forces</div>
            <div class="right-one">At CSJSA, we mentor defence aspirants and prepare them for exceling in the Services
                Selection Board Testing procedure to join the Indian Armed Forces as Officers. Our philosophy is deeply
                rooted in our ancient tradition of Manasa-Vacha-Karmana which means the alignment of mind, speech and
                actions. Alignment is mastered when the orientation of the personality is in a perfect balance or poise.
                It happens when the mind, speech and actions complement each other in a symmetric manner. This Sanskrit
                phrase is the gist of everything that the CSJSA strives to do. We mentor the students in such a way that
                there is perfect balance in their personality through the interplay of mind, speech and actions. When
                these three are in harmony, everything can be achieved, let alone the SSB. That’s our motto</div>
